Boolink is the open-source software package accompanying the manuscript "Boolink, a Graphical Interface for Open Access Boolean Network Simulations and Use in
Guard Cell CO<sub>2</sub> Signaling". It is free to download, use, and distribute. It is written in C++ and Python3, and can be run on MacOS, Windows, and Linux-based computers.

In addition to a direct installation, Boolink can be run as a Docker container on Mac OS and Linux computers. The bash scripts to do that are included here.

Boolink can simulate user-defined Boolean networks with asynchronous updates. The names of nodes, Boolean connections among nodes, number of time steps for simulation, number of initial conditions are set by the user. The entire network, as well as the activity of any particular node may be visulaized.

Users need GNU's C++ compiler (g++) and Python3 to run Boolink in the case of a direct installation. Detailed instructions to install them and Boolink itself are provided in the instruction manual documents in this repository. 

In the case of a Docker installation, instructions to install a desktop Docker client (for Mac and Linux-based operating systems) and the script to run a Docker container are included in the instruction manual as well.

The instruction manual included in the repository is identical to the Supplementary Text of the manuscript. You may choose to refer to either of them.

First, download the instruction manual word document appropriate for your operating system (e.g. Boolink_inst_manual_windows.docx for Windows) by clicking on the docx file and then clicking Download. Next, follow the steps described in the document. Some common errors and their fixes are included in the document as well. 

The documents for different operating systems are:
- Boolink_inst_manual_windows.docx for Windows
- Boolink_inst_manual_macOS.docx for Mac OS
- Boolink_inst_manual_Linux.docx for Linux
